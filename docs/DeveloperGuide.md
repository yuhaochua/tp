## **Design and Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are designed and implemented.

### Architecture

Our design draws significant inspiration from the implementation of AddressBook Level 3 (henceforth AddressBook). 
As the program was initially conceptualised to be a text-based command-line interface, heavy consideration was given
to the design and user interactions when it came to the text input to be parsed by the user. 
As such, we referenced AddressBook to segment the program into **`Parser`**, **`Command`** and **`Equipment`** classes.

**Main components of the architecture**

- **`Duke`** is the Main class and entry-point for the program. 
- **`Parser`** serves as the first filter to split raw text input and pass in arguments to the **`Command`** for further processing.
- **`Command`**, together with its various subclasses serve as specific implementations to pass the arguments taken in to the various methods of the **`EquipmentManager`** class.
- **`EquipmentManager`** keeps track of actual **`Equipment`** instances created by our program.
- **`Storage`** performs File I/O functions.

### Parser

**`Parser`** is the first filter for text inputs read to the user. 
As alluded to prior, one major consideration was to build it in a manner that can parse text input as effectively as possible. In considering text input, we divided the parsing into the following segments:

#### `commandWord` `argumentTag/argumentValue` `argumentTag/argumentValue` `...`

To dispatch `argumentTag/argumentValue` strings to the correct **`Command`** class, the following logic is employed throughout **`Parser`** by **`parseCommand`**.

**1. Parse the correct Command Word**

**`splitCommandTerm`** splits the input string upon the first space. 
The first substring is used to decide which **`Command`** to dispatch while the second is used for its arguments.
In the case where a second substring is not required, as in the case of **`help`** and **`list`**, a null String is used.

**2. Split Arguments**

For simpler command words such as **`delete`** and **`check`**, only one pair of **`argumentType`** and **`argumentValue`** were required. 
As such, these will be passed in directly to their **`Command`** classes without a **`argumentType`** pair.

More complex command words such as **`add`** and **`update`** necessitated multiple arguments.
To implement this while ensuring that multi-word strings are acceptable input, **`extractArguments`** was implemented. 
Without specifically explaining the main regular expression ([details here](https://regex101.com/r/gwjHWD/3)), the approach sought to match **`argumentTag/argumentValue`** pairs with a positive lookahead. 
The final argument pair will then be extracted using a separate regex. 
Together, this ensured that all argument pairs can be effectively parsed and dispatched to each **`Command`** class.

Throughout the `Parser` implementation, exceptions were used to return `IncorrectCommand` classes that can be used to pass error messages to the user. These will be discussed in the following segments.

### Update feature

#### Current Design and Implementation

The update feature is facilitated by `UpdateCommand`. It extends `ModificationCommand` and implements the following operations:

* `UpdateCommand#generateUpdatePairs()` — Generates pairs of attributes and their update values.
* `VersionedAddressBook#generateUpdateString()` — Generates sString with details of the update executed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the update feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user adds an equipment to the system with the help of the `add` command. The added equipment has the following attributes shown below.

Step 2. The user executes `update s/S1404115ASF n/SpeakerC c/2000 pd/2022-01-29` to update equipment with serial number S1404115ASF. `Parser#parseCommand` is called from `Duke` to parse the user's input.

Step 3. The parser recognises that an `UpdateCommand` is required, and the UpdateCommand is prepared to return to `Duke`. In the constructor of `UpdateCommand`, `prepareModification` is called to set the values of the attributes to be updated. The other attributes are set to null by default.

Step 4. `UpdateCommand#execute` is run to process the update. If the serialNumber attribute is null, a `CommandResult` with a `MISSING_SERIAL_NUMBER` output string will be returned. Otherwise, `EquipmentManager#updateEquipment` is called.

Step 5. If the update was successful, a `CommandResult` with success message will be returned, else a `CommandResult` with `UPDATE_FAILURE_MESSAGE` will be returned. Upon successful update, the object should be updated with the new attributes as shown in the diagram below.

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the objects/classes interact with each other in the case of an update command being issued by the user.

Step 6. It is not shown in the sequence diagram but ultimately when the CommandResult is returned to `Duke`, the output of the `CommandResult` gets printed out and displayed to the user.
